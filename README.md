P2-Prototype 2nd semester Medialogy 2020

This a project made by me and my 2nd semester Medialogy study group from Aalborg University. The project focuses on the topic "Human-Computer Interaction" and addresses subjects within the theme "Sustainable Lifestyles - Increasing Health through Exercise". The motivation for this project is based on studies, which show that adolescents do not get the recommended amount of physical activity of 60 minutes per day. The goal of the project is to develop computing technology that can provide exercise, and maintain the userâ€™s interest in using it. The approach to the theme of this topic has been to develop a prototype for a mobile exergame that is directed towards adolescents and provides competition and co-activity. This prototype was developed based on two requirements: (1) The exergame should be motion-controlled and provide indirect competition and co-activity between players. (2) The gameplay should cause the user to be active with moderate to vigorous-intensity. The evaluation revealed that the exergame is capable of providing  movement intense enough for users to reach moderate-intensity exercise.
